Hi! I'm Jann, a 21 year old computer science student from Germany.

I am active in the cybersecurity club of my university and spend some of my free time contributing to open-source projects, mainly [TagStudio](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio).

I also maintain a small NAS at home to host some services for myself. Said NAS also collects comment / guestbook submissions on this site for me to review later, so if that is broken you know why.

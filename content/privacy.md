# Privacy Policy
## General

I currently use GitHub Pages to host the static content of this site so anything transmitted by your browser is subject to whatever they do with it. This may change in the future (e.g. I may decide to self-host it instead).

## Forms
When you submit a form on this website, the following is collected:
- Any data entered into the form
- Your IP address
- Your User Agent String

What happens to that data:
- Data entered in forms *may* be published on the site
  - Typically in the form of guestbook entries, referrer statistic, comments, etc.
- IP and UA String will not be published[^1] and will be retained until I clean up my logs.
  - This is mostly in case of spamming/ddos/etc. so I can investigate.

[^1]: Nor will any third-party be allowed to access it in any way. Only exception could be if someone helps me with system maintenance, my NAS is stolen ^^, or something similar.

## Changes

Any changes to this privacy policy will be published here.

So, one afternoon, a couple of months ago, I got bored and ended up browsing the dark web.
Against my expectations I quickly found myself back on the clear web on an onscure blog whose .onion address had been linked to on a link list.
Reading around the blog proved fascinating, not necessarily for the content of it (eventhough there was some interesting stuff there, see [artemislena.eu](https://artemislena.eu/)), but more so for something it linked to: <u>A webring</u>.

For those that don't know (I didn't): A [webring](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/webring) basically consists of a bunch of websites that link to each other in a circle, usually with some kind of common theme and a common navigation bar.
What fascinated me about this was that this was a relic of the old internet which I had believed to have died when social media came around.
Yet here it was, alive and well, just hidden from view waiting for one to find a website from which to start *surfing*.

- had a nice evening
- kind of forgot about it for a while
- thought of it again
  - had a blast *again*
- decided to redo my site in the spirit of it
  - old was also ugly
